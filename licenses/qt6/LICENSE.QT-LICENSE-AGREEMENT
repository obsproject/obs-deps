customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the
terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other
Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to
third parties ("Confidential Information"). Accordingly, when a Party (the
"Receiving Party") receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the
"Disclosing Party"), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information
to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its
employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all
Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential
Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written
approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential
Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and
fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall
take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other
Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party
to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.

Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or
becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the
Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to
the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or
use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the
Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not
had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven
by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to
the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an
obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled
to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing
Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential
nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to
limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential
Information to the minimum extent necessary.

The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a
period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade
secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade
secret laws.

10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT

10.1. License Fees

License Fees are described in The Qt Company's standard price list, quote or
Purchase Order confirmation or in an Appendix 2 hereto, as the case may be.

Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the License Fees shall
not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for any reason
whatsoever.

10.2. Ordering Licenses

Licensee may purchase Development Licenses, Distribution Licenses and QA Tools
Licenses pursuant to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have
been agreed upon, at The Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the
time of purchase.

Unless expressly otherwise agreed, any price or other term quoted to the
Licensee or specified herein shall only be valid for the thirty (30) days from
the effective date of this Agreement, Appendix 2 or the date of the quote, as
applicable.

Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and
Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable
to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a "Purchase Order")
for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the
Parties.

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all Purchase Orders for Licensed Software
the Licensee makes during the Agreement Term shall be governed exclusively
under the terms of this Agreement.

10.3. Distribution License Packs

Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of
Distribution License Packs.

Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will
have an account of Distribution Licenses available for distributing the
Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.

Each time Licensee distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one
Distribution License is used, and Licensee's account of available Distribution
Licenses is decreased accordingly.

Licensee may distribute copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has
Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.

10.4. Payment Terms

License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by
Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice
from The Qt Company.

The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this
Agreement and/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.

A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the
interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid
balances that remain past due and which have not been disputed by the Licensee
in good faith.

10.5. Taxes

All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but
exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax, withholding tax and other
taxes, duties or tariffs ("Taxes") levied directly for the sale, delivery or
use of Licensed Software hereunder pursuant to any applicable law. Such
applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee to The Qt Company, or, where
applicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes to The Qt Company, Licensee shall
provide an exemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable
authority.

11. RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS

11.1. Licensee's Record-keeping

Licensee shall at all times during the Agreement Term and for a period of two
(2) years thereafter maintain Licensee's Records in an accurate and up-to-date
form. Licensee's Records shall be adequate to reasonably enable The Qt Company
to determine Licensee's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. The
records shall conform to general good accounting practices.

Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company's request
to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report based on Licensee's Records,
such report to contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) number and
identity of users working with Licensed Software or Open Source Qt, (ii) copies
of Redistributables distributed by Licensee during the most recent calendar
quarter and/or any other term specified by The Qt Company, , and (iii) any
other information pertaining to Licensee's compliance with the terms of this
Agreement (like e.g. information on products and/or projects relating to use of
Distribution Licenses), as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to
time.

11.2. The Qt Company's Audit Rights

The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company's,
may, upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice and at its expense,
audit Licensee with respect to the Licensee's use of the Licensed Software, but
not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be
conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee's
place of business. Any possible in-person audit shall be conducted during
regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably
interfere with Licensee's business activities and shall be limited in scope to
verify Licensee's compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The Qt Company
or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled
to inspect Licensee's Records and conduct necessary interviews of Licensee's
relevant employees and Contractors. All such Licensee's Records and use thereof
shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.

If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope
of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee shall pay to The Qt Company any
amounts owed for such unauthorized use within 30 days from receipt of the
corresponding invoice from The Qt Company.

In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms
of this Agreement (without limitation, either (i) underpayment of more than 10
% of License Fees or 10,000 euros (whichever is more) or (ii) distribution of
products, which include or result from Prohibited Combination, shall be deemed
a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall
pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.

12. TERM AND TERMINATION

12.1. Agreement Term

This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and
remain in force until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12
("Agreement Term").

12.2. Termination for breach and suspension of rights
Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)
days prior written notice if the other Party commits a material breach of any
obligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice
period.

Instead of termination, The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend or
withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but
not limited to the Development Licenses, Distribution License, and Support,
should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion or otherwise violates or
is reasonably suspected to violate its obligations or terms of this Agreement,
and where such violation or breach is not cured within ten (10) business days
following The Qt Company's written notice thereof.

12.3. Termination for insolvency

Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon
written notice in the event that the other Party becomes insolvent, files for
any form of bankruptcy, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, has
a receiver, administrative receiver or officer appointed over the whole or a
substantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act
equivalent to any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the
other Party.

12.4. Parties' Rights and Duties upon Termination

Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement, Licensee shall cease and shall
cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates' and
Contractors') to cease using the Licensed Software under this Agreement. For
clarity, a Development License of a Designated User or a QA Tools License, and
all rights relating thereto, shall always terminate at the expiry of the
respective Development License Term, even if the Agreement continues to remain
in force.

Upon such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt Company
all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify
the same by Licensee's duly authorized officer to The Qt Company upon its
request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of
the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued
support to Customers.

Except when this Agreement is terminated by The Qt Company due to Licensee's
material breach as set forth in Section 12.2, the Licensee may continue
distribution of Applications and Devices under the terms of this Agreement
despite the termination of this Agreement. In such event the terms hereof will
continue to be applicable and govern any such distribution of Applications and
Devices beyond the expiry or termination of this Agreement. In case of
termination by The Qt Company due to Licensee's material breach, Licensee must
cease any distribution of Applications and Devices at the date of termination
of this Agreement.

Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not
relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable
to The Qt Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee pay
to The Qt Company all such fees within 30 days from the effective date of
termination of this Agreement.

Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to
continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated
Redistributables).

12.5. Extension of Rights under Special Circumstances

In the event of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development License(s)
or QA Tools Licenses, as set forth in Section 3.1 and 3.5 respectively, and
where such decision of non-renewal is not due to any ongoing breach or alleged
breach (as reasonably determined by The Qt Company) by Licensee of the terms of
this Agreement or any applicable license terms of Open Source Qt, then all
valid and affected Development Licenses and QA Tools licenses possessed by the
Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the
terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional
licenses as set forth in Section 10.2.

In the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable
decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of
expiry of the Development License(s) or QA Tools Licenses, assigned to party,
who has assumed The Qt Company's position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed
Software under this Agreement, then all valid Development Licenses and QA Tools
Licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the
Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in
perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.

For clarity, in case of an extension under this Section 12.5, any such
extension shall not apply to The Qt Company's Support obligations, but Support
shall be provided only up until the end of the respective fixed Development
License Term regardless of the extension of relevant Development License or QA
Tools License, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.

13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE

In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Inc., a Delaware
Corporation, then:
    (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with
        the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding its choice of law
        provisions;
    (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
        of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and
    (iii) any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this
        Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
        validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or
        applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by
        arbitration in San Francisco, USA, before one arbitrator. The
        arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined
        Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered
        in any court having jurisdiction. This Section shall not preclude
        parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a
        court of appropriate jurisdiction.

In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Qt Company Ltd., a Finnish
Company, then:
    (i) this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with
        the laws of Finland, excluding its choice of law provisions;
    (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
        of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and
    (iii) any disputes, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
        Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be
        finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules
        of International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration tribunal shall
        consist of one (1), or if either Party so requires, of three (3),
        arbitrators. The award shall be final and binding and enforceable in
        any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be held in
        Helsinki, Finland and the process shall be conducted in the English
        language. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking
        provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate
        jurisdiction.

14. GENERAL PROVISIONS

14.1. No Assignment

Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate
assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its
rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of The Qt Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Qt Company shall be entitled to freely assign or transfer any of its
rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement.

14.2. No Third-Party Representations

Licensee shall make no representations or warranties concerning the Licensed
Software on behalf of The Qt Company. Any representation or warranty Licensee
makes or purports to make on The Qt Company's behalf shall be void as to
The Qt Company.

14.3. Surviving Sections

Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should
survive termination of this Agreement shall so be deemed to survive. Such
sections include especially the following: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12.4, 13 and 14.

14.4. Entire Agreement

This Agreement, the Appendices hereto, the License Certificate and any
applicable quote and Purchase Order accepted by The Qt Company constitute the
complete agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral,
with respect to the subject matters discussed herein.

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any
Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over the terms of the
Purchase Order with respect to such conflict or inconsistency.

Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that this Agreement prevails over
any click-to-accept or similar agreements the Designated Users may need to
accept online upon download of the Licensed Software, as may be required by
The Qt Company's applicable processes relating to Licensed Software.

14.5. Modifications

No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless contained in a
writing executed by an authorized representative of each Party. No term or
condition contained in Licensee's Purchase Order ("Deviating Terms") shall
apply unless The Qt Company has expressly agreed such Deviating Terms in
writing. Unless and to the extent expressly agreed by The Qt Company, any such
Deviating Terms shall be deemed void and with no legal effect. For clarity,
delivery of the Licensed Software following the receipt of the Purchase Order
including Deviating Terms shall not constitute acceptance of such Deviating
Terms.

14.6. Force Majeure

Except for the payment obligations hereunder, neither Party shall be liable to
the other for any delay or non-performance of its obligations hereunder in the
event and to the extent that such delay or non-performance is due to an event
of act of God, terrorist attack or other similar unforeseeable catastrophic
event that prevents either Party for fulfilling its obligations under this
Agreement and which such Party cannot avoid or circumvent ("Force Majeure
Event"). If the Force Majeure Event results in a delay or non-performance of a
Party for a period of three (3) months or longer, then either Party shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without any
liability (except for the obligations of payment arising prior to the event of
Force Majeure) towards the other Party.

14.7. Notices

Any notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given and
deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing
or when successfully delivered to the recipient by hand, fax, or special
courier during normal business hours on a business day to the addresses
specified for each Party on the signature page. Each communication and document
made or delivered by one Party to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement
shall be in the English language.

14.8. Export Control

Licensee acknowledges that the Redistributables, as incorporated in
Applications or Devices, may be subject to export control restrictions under
the applicable laws of respective countries. Licensee shall fully comply with
all applicable export license restrictions and requirements as well as with all
laws and regulations relating to the Redistributables and exercise of licenses
hereunder and shall procure all necessary governmental authorizations,
including without limitation, all necessary licenses, approvals, permissions or
consents, where necessary for the re-exportation of the Redistributables,
Applications and/or Devices.

14.9. No Implied License

There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this
Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall
remain with The Qt Company and its licensors. In addition, no licenses or
immunities are granted to the combination of the Licensed Software with any
other software or hardware not delivered by The Qt Company under this
Agreement.

14.10. Attorney Fees

The prevailing Party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled
to recover its attorney's fees and costs in connection with such action, as to
be ordered by the relevant dispute resolution body.

14.11. Privacy

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that for the purpose of this Agreement,
The Qt Company may collect, use, transfer and disclose personal data pertaining
to Designated Users as well as any other employees and directors of the
Licensee and its Contractors relevant for carrying out the intent of this
Agreement. Such personal data will be primarily collected from the relevant
individuals but may be collected also from Licensee (e.g. in the course of
Licensee's reporting obligations). The Parties acknowledge that as
The Qt Company determines the purpose and means for such collection and
processing of the applicable personal data, The Qt Company shall be regarded as
the Data Controller under the applicable Data Protection Legislation.
The Qt Company shall process any such personal data in accordance with its
privacy and security policies and practices, which will comply with all
applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation.

14.12. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or
eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall
otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

14.13. Marketing Rights

Parties have agreed upon Marketing Rights pursuant to Appendix 7, if any.
